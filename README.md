This repository contains the exercise made in the HPC courses with OpenMp, Cuda and HLS covering the three major technique to accelerate and optimize programs. There are also 3 assignment (one for each main topic) where are implied different types of optimizations to a program. There will also be a pdf file showing discussion on optimization made.
